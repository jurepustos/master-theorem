\title{Bachman-Landau notation and the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences}

The primary goal of this project is to formalize some results from computational 
complexity theory in Lean 4:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Bachman-Landau family of notations, e.g. big O and other closely related notations,
\item properties of the Bachman-Landau notations,
\item the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences,
\item and, if time permits, the Akra-Bazzi method which solves a more general class of recurrences
\end{itemize}

    By definition of asymptotic positivity, there exists an $x\_0$ such that $f(x) > 0$
    for all $x > x\_0$. It follows that $-f(x) > 0$, which is what is needed.

\section{Asymptotic inequality}

\subsection{Positivity and negativity}

    \label{lemma:asymp_pos_of_pos_le}
    \lean{asymp_pos_of_pos_le}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_pos, def:asymp_le}
    Let $f$ be asymptotically positive and let it be asymptotically less than $g$.
    Then $g$ is asymptotically positive.

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Assume with no loss of generality that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x > x\_0$ and that
    $f(y) \le g(y)$ for all $y > y\_0$. Let $z\_0 = \max \{ x\_0, y\_0 \}$. By transitivity

    Assume with no loss of generality that $g(x) < 0$ for all $x > x\_0$ and that
    $f(y) \le g(y)$ for all $y > y\_0$. Let $z\_0 = \max \{ x\_0, y\_0 \}$. By transitivity

    By Theorem \ref{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff}, this statement is equivalent to Lemma

    \lean{asymp_le_refl}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le}
    $f$ is asymptotically less than $f$.
\end{lemma}

    \lean{asymp_ge_refl}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_ge}
    $f$ is asymptotically greater than $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok

    \lean{asymp_le_of_ge}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le, def:asymp_ge}
    Let $f$ be asymptotically less than $g$. Then $g$ is asymptotically
    greater than $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Since $f(x) \le g(x)$ for all $x > x\_0$, we have $g(x) \ge f(x)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_ge_of_le}
    \lean{asymp_ge_of_le}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le, def:asymp_ge}
    Let $f$ be asymptotically greater than $g$. Then $g$ is asymptotically
    less than $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Since $f(x) \ge g(x)$ for all $x > x\_0$, we have $g(x) \le f(x)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff}
    \lean{asymp_le_ge_iff}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le, def:asymp_ge}
    $f$ is asymptotically less than $g$ if and only if $g$ is asymptotically
    greater than $f$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_le_of_ge, lemma:asymp_ge_of_le}
    Lemma \ref{lemma:asymp_le_of_ge} and Lemma \ref{lemma:asymp_ge_of_le} are both directions
    respectively.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Additivity}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_le_add}
    \lean{asymp_le_add}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le}
    Let $f\_1$ be asymptotically less than $g\_1$ and $f\_2$ be asymptotically less
    than $g\_2$. Then $f\_1 + f\_2$ is asymptotically less than $g\_1 + g\_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Let $x\_0$ be such that $f\_1(x) \le g\_1(x)$ for all $x > x\_0$ and let $y\_0$ be
    such that $f\_2(y) \le g\_2(y)$ for all $y > y\_0$. Those exist due to assumptions.
    Now let $z\_0 = \max \{ x\_0, y\_0 \}$. By transitivity, $f\_1(z) \le g\_1(z)$ and 
    $f\_2(z) \le g\_2(z)$ for all $z > z\_0$. By additivity, we can merge both 
    inequalities by adding both terms on the left side and both terms on the right side.
    We thus get $f\_1(z) + f\_2(z) \le g\_1(z) + g\_2(z)$, which by definition and 
    and extensionality means that $f\_1 + f\_2$ is asymptotically less than $g\_1 + g\_2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_ge_add}
    \lean{asymp_ge_add}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_ge}
    Let $f\_1$ be asymptotically greater than $g\_1$ and $f\_2$ be asymptotically greater
    than $g\_2$. Then $f\_1 + f\_2$ is asymptotically greater than $g\_1 + g\_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff, def:asymp_le, lemma:asymp_le_add}
    By Theorem \ref{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff}, $g\_1$ and $g\_2$ are asymptotically less 
    than $f\_1$ and $f\_2$ respectively. It suffices to show that $g\_1 + g\_2$ is
    asymptotically less than $f\_1 + f\_2$, which is precisely the result of
    Lemma \ref{lemma:asymp_le_add}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_ge_add_pos}
    \lean{asymp_ge_add_pos}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_pos, def:asymp_ge}
    Let $f\_1$ be asymptotically positive. Let also $f\_2$ be asymptotically greater 
    than $g$. Then $f\_1 + f\_2$ is asymptotically greater than $g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    By definition, there exists some $x\_0$ such that $f\_1(x) > 0$ for all $x > x\_0$.
    We also have $f\_2(y) \ge g(y)$ for all $y > y\_0$ for some $y\_0$. Let
    $z\_0 = \max \{ x\_0, y\_0, \}$. We now have, for all $z > z\_0$ both $f\_1(z) > 0$
    and $f\_2(z) \ge g(z)$. By additivity, we have $f\_1(z) + f\_2(z) \ge g(z)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_le_add_neg}
    \lean{asymp_le_add_neg}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_neg, def:asymp_ge}
    Let $f\_1$ be asymptotically negative. Let also $f\_2$ be asymptotically less 
    than $g$. Then $f\_1 + f\_2$ is asymptotically less than $g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    By definition, there exists some $x\_0$ such that $f\_1(x) < 0$ for all $x > x\_0$.
    We also have $f\_2(y) \le g(y)$ for all $y > y\_0$ for some $y\_0$. Let
    $z\_0 = \max \{ x\_0, y\_0, \}$. We now have, for all $z > z\_0$ both $f\_1(z) < 0$
    and $f\_2(z) \le g(z)$. By additivity, we have $f\_1(z) + f\_2(z) \le g(z)$. 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Scalar multiplicativity}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_le_pos_smul}
    \lean{asymp_le_pos_smul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_le}
    Let $c > 0$ and let $f$ be asymptotically less than $g$. Then $c \cdot f$ is asymptotically
    less than $c \cdot g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    This is a simple consequence of scalar multiplication by a positive constant.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_ge_pos_smul}
    \lean{asymp_ge_pos_smul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_ge}
    Let $c > 0$ and let $f$ be asymptotically greater than $g$. Then $c \cdot f$ is asymptotically
    greater than $c \cdot g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff, lemma:asymp_le_pos_smul}
    By applying Theorem \ref{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff}, the proof boils down to proving that
    $c \cdot g$ is asymptotically less than $c \cdot f$, which is precisely shown
    by Lemma \ref{lemma:asymp_le_pos_smul}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_le_neg_smul}
    \lean{asymp_le_neg_smul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_neg, def:asymp_le, def:asymp_ge}
    Let $c < 0$ and let $f$ be asymptotically less than $g$. Then $c \cdot f$ is asymptotically
    greater than $c \cdot g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    This is a simple consequence of the fact that if $f(x) \le g(x)$, then for a $c < 0$
    we have $c \cdot f(x) \ge c \cdot g(x)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_ge_neg_smul}
    \lean{asymp_ge_neg_smul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_neg, def:asymp_ge, def:asymp_le}
    Let $c < 0$ and let $f$ be asymptotically greater than $g$. Then $c \cdot f$ is asymptotically
    less than $c \cdot g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff, lemma:asymp_le_neg_smul}
    Similar to above, the proof is a direct application of Theorem \ref{thm:asymp_le_ge_iff}
    and Lemma \ref{lemma:asymp_le_neg_smul}.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Multiplicativity}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:asymp_le_nonneg_mul}
    \lean{asymp_le_nonneg_mul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_nonneg, def:asymp_le}
    Let $f\_1$ and $f\_2$ be asymptotically nonnegative functions. If f$\_1$ is asymptotically
    less than $g\_1$ and $f\_2$ is asymptotically less than $g\_2$, then $f\_1 * f\_2$
    is asymptotically less than $g\_1 * g\_2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Asymptotic properties give constants $x\_i, 0 \le i \le 3$, above which each property holds.
    We take $x_M = \max_{0 \le i \le 3} x_i$ as the constant of the needed property. 
    For all $x > x_M$, all given asymptotic properties hold, so the wanted property holds
    by properties of the inequality relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:asymp_ge_nonpos_mul}
    \lean{asymp_ge_nonpos_mul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_nonpos, def:asymp_ge, def:asymp_le}
    Let $f\_1$ and $f\_2$ be asymptotically nonpositive functions. If f$\_1$ is asymptotically
    greater than $g\_1$ and $f\_2$ is asymptotically greater than $g\_2$, then $f\_1 * f\_2$
    is asymptotically less than $g\_1 * g\_2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    Analogously to above, the proof comes from taking the maximum of asymptotic constants 
    as the asymptotic lower bound for nonpositivity. This time, however, the inequality
    flips due to nonpositive terms in $f\_1(n) * f\_2(n) \le g\_1(n) * g\_2(n)$, since 
    $n$ is larger than all of the asymptotic lower bounds.
\end{proof}

    If $f$ is dominated by $g$, then it's also bounded above by $g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok 
    The definitions of $f$ being dominated and bounded above by $g$ only differ
    in the quantifier before $k$ at the very start (universal for the former, existential
    for the latter), so it suffices to use any positive value for $k$. We can use $1$.

\section{Bachman-Landau notation}

Bachman-Landau family of notations is the name of a few closely related notations used in 
algorithm analysis. The most famous of them is the so-called big-O notation. While
most formulations are defined on functions from naturals or reals to reals, we define 
them more generally - requirements for the types of the domain and codomain vary between 
different properties. However, all properties hold for functions from a linearly ordered 
commutative ring to a linearly ordered field. In the rest of this page, we let $R$ be a linearly 
ordered commutative ring and $F$ be a linearly ordered field. We will also use symbols $f$, 
$f\_1$, $f\_2$, $g$, $g\_1$ and $g\_2$ for functions $R \to F$. Also, we let $M$ be 
a right $R$-module, although it is often only required be a (distributive) left multiplicative 
action on $R$.

    \leanok
    \uses{def:small_o, def:big_o}
    If $f(x) \in o(g(x))$, then $f(x) \in O(f(x))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}
    Since $o(g(x))$ and $O(f(x))$, we can simply use Theorem 
    \ref{lemma:asymp_right_dom_imp_bounded_above}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:small_omega_imp_big_omega}
    \lean{ω_imp_Ω}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:small_omega, def:big_omega}
    If $f(x) \in \omega(g(x))$, then $f(x) \in \Omega(g(x))$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_left_dom_imp_bounded_below}
    The proof is a simple application of Theorem 
    \ref{lemma:asymp_left_dom_imp_bounded_below}.

\subsection{Properties of asymptotic growth}

\subsubsection{Reflexivity}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_bounded_refl}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_refl}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded}
    $f(x)$ is asymptotically bounded by itself. 

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded, def:asymp_bounded_above, def:asymp_bounded_below}
    Proving asymptotic boundedness is equivalent to proving boundedness above and below.
    Both can be proved the same way - we choose $1_K$ for $K$ and $1_R$ for $N$, then the
    required asymptotic growth properties follow from definitions of identity elements for 
    $K$ and $R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_bounded_above_refl}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_above_refl}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded_above}
    $f(x)$ is asymptotically bounded above by itself.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_bounded_refl}
    This follows directly from \ref{lemma:asymp_bounded_refl}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_bounded_below_refl}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_below_refl}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded_below}
    $f(x)$ is asymptotically bounded below by itself.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_bounded_refl}
    This follows directly from \ref{lemma:asymp_bounded_refl}.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Scalar multiplicativity}


\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_bounded_above_pos_smul}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_above_pos_smul}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded_above}
    Let $c > 0$. If $f(x)$ is bounded above by $(gx)$, then $c*f(x)$ is also bounded
    above by $g(x)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    TODO
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Additivity}


\section{The Master theorem}

Analyzing the time complexity of algorithms, especially recursive ones, is more often 
than not a non-trivial task. For a recursive algorithm, its time complexity can be 
written as a recurrence formula, which is generally not easy, sometimes even impossible 
to solve with a closed formula. In some cases, though, it turns out that we can find 
asymptotic bounds of the solution, despite not being able to necessarily find the 
precise solution to the recurrence. One class of such cases is the class of 
divide-and-conquer algorithms, i.e. algorithms that work by recursively splitting the input 
problem into similarly-sized subproblems. Those have especially nice recurrence formulas 
which can be asymptotically bounded with an elegant formula that is known as the Master theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences]
