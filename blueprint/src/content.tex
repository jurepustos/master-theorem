\title{Bachman-Landau notation and the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences}

The primary goal of this project is to formalize some results from computational 
complexity theory in Lean 4:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Bachman-Landau family of notations, e.g. big O and other closely related notations,
\item properties of the Bachman-Landau notations and relations between them,
\item the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences,
\item and, if time permits, the Akra-Bazzi method which solves a more general class of recurrences
\end{itemize}

\section{Bachman-Landau notation}

Bachman-Landau family of notations is the name of a few closely related notations used in 
algorithm analysis. The most famous of them is the so-called big-O notation. While
most formulations are defined on functions from naturals or reals to reals, we define 
them more generally on functions from a linearly ordered commutative ring to a
linearly ordered field. In the rest of this page, we let $R$ be a linearly ordered 
commutative ring and $F$ be a linearly ordered field. We will also use symbols $f$ and 
$g$ for functions $R \to F$.

\subsection{Relations between asymptotic sets}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}
    \lean{asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_dominated, def:asymp_bounded_above}
    If $f(x)$ is dominated by $g(x)$, then it's also bounded above by $g(x)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok 
    The definitions of $f(x)$ being dominated and bounded above by $g(x)$ only differ
    in the quantifier before $k$ at the very start (universal for the former, existential
    for the latter), so it suffices to use any positive value for $k$. We use $1$. 
    The desired result then follows directly.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:small_o_imp_big_o}
    \lean{o_imp_O}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:small_o, def:big_o}
    If $f(x) \in o(g(x))$, then $f(x) \in O(f(x))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}
    Since $o(g(x))$ and $O(f(x))$, we can simply use Theorem 
    \ref{lemma:asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:asymp_dominates_imp_bounded_below}
    \lean{asymp_dominates_imp_bounded_below}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_dominates, def:asymp_bounded_below}
    If $f(x)$ dominates $g(x)$, then it's bounded below by $g(x)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    The proof is entirely analogous to the proof of Theorem 
    \ref{lemma:asymp_dominated_imp_bounded_above}, again using the value 
    $1$ for $k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:small_omega_imp_big_omega}
    \lean{ω_imp_Ω}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:small_omega, def:big_omega}
    If $f(x) \in \omega(g(x))$, then $f(x) \in \Omega(g(x))$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{lemma:asymp_dominates_imp_bounded_below}
    The proof is a simple application of Theorem 
    \ref{lemma:asymp_dominates_imp_bounded_below}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:asymp_bounded_above_and_below_equiv_bounded}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_above_and_below_equiv_bounded}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:asymp_bounded_above, def:asymp_bounded_below, def:asymp_bounded}
    If $f(x)$ is bounded above and below by $g(x)$, then it's bounded by $g(x)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    First, assume $f(x)$ is bounded above and below by $g(x)$. There is a constant
    $k\_1 > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \le k\_1 |g(x)|$ for all $x > x\_0$ for some $x\_0$.
    Analogously, there is a constant $k\_2 > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \ge k\_2 |g(x)|$ 
    for all $x > x\_1$ for some $x\_1$. For $f(x)$ to be properly bounded by $g(x)$ 
    we need a single constant $x\_2$ - we take $x\_2 = \max{\{x\_1, x\_2\}}$. Since 
    $x\_2 \ge x\_0$ and $x\_2 \ge x\_1$, we have $|f(x) \le k\_1 |g(x)|$ and 
    $|f(x)| \ge k\_2 |g(x)|$ for all $x > x\_2$, which means that $f(x)$ is bounded
    by $g(x)$.

    Conversely, assume $f(x)$ is bounded by $g(x)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:big_o_and_omega_equiv_theta}
    \lean{O_and_Ω_equiv_Θ}
    \leanok
    \uses{def:big_o, def:big_omega, def:big_theta}
    $f(x) \in O(g(x))$ and $f(x) \in \Omega(g(x))$ if and only if $f(x) \in \Theta(g(x))$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    \uses{thm:asymp_bounded_above_and_below_equiv_bounded}
    Similarly to previous proofs, the proof is a direct application of Theorem 
    \ref{thm:asymp_bounded_above_and_below_equiv_bounded}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{thm:asymp_bounded_imp_not_dominated}
    \lean{asymp_bounded_imp_not_dominated}
    \leanok
    If $f(x)$ is bounded by $g(x)$, then $f(x)$ is not dominated by $g(x)$.
\end{lemma}

\section{The Master theorem}

Analyzing the time complexity of algorithms, especially recursive ones, is more often 
than not a non-trivial task. For a recursive algorithm, its time complexity can be 
written as a recurrence formula, which is generally not easy, sometimes even impossible 
to solve with a closed formula. In some cases, though, it turns out that we can find 
asymptotic bounds of the solution, despite not being able to necessarily find the 
precise solution to the recurrence. One class of such cases is the class of 
divide-and-conquer algorithms, i.e. algorithms that work by recursively splitting the input 
problem into similarly-sized subproblems. Those have especially nice recurrence formulas 
which can be asymptotically bounded with an elegant formula that is known as the Master theorem.
