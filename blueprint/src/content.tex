\title{Bachman-Landau notation and the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences}

The primary goal of this project is to formalize some results from computational 
complexity theory in Lean 4:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Bachman-Landau family of notations, e.g. big O and other closely related notations,
\item properties of the Bachman-Landau notations,
\item the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences,
\item and, if time permits, the Akra-Bazzi method which solves a more general class of recurrences
\end{itemize}
