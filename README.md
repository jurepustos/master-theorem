# Bachman-Landau notation and the Master themorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences

This is a formalization project for the Formalized Mathematics and Proof 
Assistants course at UL FMF by Andrej Bauer. It defines and and proves
basic properties of the main part of the Bachman-Landau family of notations 
(Big O etc.)The Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences is also 
formally proved, with both upper and lower bounds. We only deal with the case
of recurrences of functions on natural numbers.
