# Bachman-Landau notation and the Master themorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences

This is a formalization project for the Formalized Mathematics and Proof 
Assistants course at UL FMF by Andrej Bauer. First shall we define and prove 
basic properties of a part of the Bachman-Landau family of notations, then we
state and prove the Master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences.
Optionally, if time permits, we will state and prove the Akra-Bazzi theorem,
which gives a method of solving more general recurrences.
